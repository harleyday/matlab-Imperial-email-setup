# matlab-Imperial-email-setup

Note that this code will connect you to the Imperial College London email servers only. To connect to another institution, you may have to edit some of the server addresses, port numbers, username formats etc... If you have an Imperial emil address, then the code should work as it is. Just follow the instructions in the GUI!
